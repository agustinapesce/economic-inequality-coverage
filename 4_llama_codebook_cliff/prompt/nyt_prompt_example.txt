"The Gender Pay Gap  Summary summary summary To the Editor: ''Salary Transparency Fails to Fix the Gender Pay Gap''  (Business, July 4) contains numerous examples and anecdotes about the benefits of taking actions to close the gender pay gap. We agree that transparency is an important component to building inclusive cultures -- but it goes beyond knowing what your co-worker earns. The gender pay gap is a result of pay inequity and unequal representation at all pay levels throughout an organization. Therefore, instituting a pay transparency policy without taking other actions -- such as regularly conducting pay equity analyses; banning salary history requests by employers; and evaluating recruitment, promotion, and talent development systems for bias -- would still leave an organization with a pay gap. There is no ''one and done'' action that will close a company's gender pay gap. Instituting salary transparency is an ''and'' -- a policy that should be put in place in addition to taking steps to ensure an equal playing field.
